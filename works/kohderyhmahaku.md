## Background

Kohderyhmähaku is a web application for boosting B2B sales and marketing by providing users a tool where they can find potential customers and partners.
I had multiple roles in the project, first being the designer. The design tool used in this project was **Figma**. I did multiple iterations of different layouts and tested various prototypes with my team.

## Design

The goal of the new design was to simplify the service to new and old users and refreshen the visual design. This meant clearing up search parameters names and clearer categorizing.

## Development

Kohderyhmähaku was done with React, Typescript and Ant Design was used as a Design System. I had my first touch on configuring Webpack and React hooks and Context API in this project.
