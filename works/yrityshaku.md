## Development

Yrityshaku was my first big React project and I consider it my firstborn. Being part of designing and developing it is probably one of the highlights of my career. Technologywise I got my first touch on real world React development, Redux and Typescript.

## Menestyjät-lista and Protestilista

The frontpage and companypage of Yrityshaku's basic layout was mostly done when I came in, but Menestyjät-lista and Protestilista still needed revamping so this was my first big design task. Yrityshaku was part of Kauppalehti.fi Yritykset section as was Menestyjät-lista which is a list of well performed companies in Finland. Protestlista is a record of companies unhonoured bills of exchange in Finland.
